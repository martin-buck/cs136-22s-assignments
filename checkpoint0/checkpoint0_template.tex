{\Large{\bf Collaboration Statement:}}

Turning in this assignment indicates you have abided by the course Collaboration Policy:

\url{www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/136/2022s/index.html#collaboration-policy}

Total hours spent: TODO

We consulted the following resources:
\begin{itemize}
\item TODO
\item TODO
\item $\ldots$	
\end{itemize}

FYI Official instructions for this checkpoint can be found at:

\url{www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/136/2022s/checkpoint0.html}


\newpage

Note: the submission length limit for this is one page (not including the cover page).  You should not be writing more than a few sentences to a paragraph for each of these pieces.

\section{Team}

TODO: List the names of everyone working on your team.  You are strongly encouraged to work in groups of 2.  Groups of 3 must do 2 upgrades.  Groups of 1 and 3 should seek permission from me.  

\section{Dataset}

\subsection{Dataset Access}

TODO: Write the name of your dataset, how it can be accessed (likely a URL to the download site).  Write a brief (a few sentences) description of the dataset.

\subsection{Dataset Properties}

TODO: Describe the properties of this dataset that demonstrate it satisfies the number of instances and number of dimensions dataset requirements.

\subsection{Model-Related Properties}

TODO: Tell us the model you are planning to use (this can be changed later), and its requirements in terms of data types.  For example, logistic regression requires a binary target to predict, Dirichlet-categorical requires discrete data (and no target).  Specifically name the features/labels from your dataset that you plan to use to satisfy these model requirements, and which requirement each one satisfies (for example, I plan to use feature a as a binary target for logistic regression).  (Note: this can also be changed later.  We just want to make sure you are choosing a dataset that is appropriate for one of the models you can use.)
